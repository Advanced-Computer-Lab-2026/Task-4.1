# Course Review Board — ACL UI/UX Lab

This is a **standalone React demo** for one session of the UI/UX Rescue Challenge. It uses realistic example records stored in this browser; it does not connect to MongoDB or the previous lab API.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The terminal prints **one local URL**. Open that link in your normal external browser. The development server will **not** open a browser automatically. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

## Functional brief

Users browse reviews and course summaries. Course codes in the review list open a separate, shareable course-details page showing the course name, short description, teaching history for 2024/25 and 2025/26, and its student reviews. All staff names are fictional sample data, not historical claims. A reviewer may write one review per course and edit only their own reviews. Ratings must be integers 1–5.

### Fields from the prior lab

- `courseCode` — Course code: required text
- `rating` — Rating: whole number 1 to 5
- `comment` — Comment: optional

The demo supports create/edit and stores your updates in browser `localStorage` for this browser. **Reset demo** restores the example records. You can assume the current signed-in user is `You`.

## User scenario for this session

A student is choosing a course, wants to understand previous student feedback and then submit a review for another course.

Your redesign should support the scenario above without removing or weakening the existing features.

## UI/UX Rescue Challenge (25–30 minutes)

**Your mission:** use this interface as an end user, find **at least three distinct, meaningful UI/UX problems**, and fix all three with AI assistance.

- Explain the user's goal and why each issue hurts usability.
- Ask AI to suggest alternatives and compare trade-offs before you implement a solution.
- Choose your own changes; there is no prescribed visual redesign.
- Preserve all working behavior and relevant validation.
- Demonstrate the main action, one unsuccessful action, and your three improvements.

**Submit:** the modified React files, before/after screenshots, three brief justifications, and one example of an AI design suggestion you refined or rejected.

**Evaluation:** We assess usability reasoning, design consistency, preserved functionality, and testing. Using AI is allowed and expected. Cosmetic changes alone are not sufficient.
